# APTpy

This package brings the functionality of the APT R library to Python, as well as some additional capabilities and improvements.  APT stands for Asymmetric Price Transmission, which we will model using asymmetric threshold vector autoregressions (AT-VECM).

A good reference for the models in this package is Enders and Siklos (2001)
